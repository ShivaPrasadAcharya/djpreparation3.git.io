# 1.b.7 Theories of Rights

Here is a detailed comparison between the Interest Theory (or Benefit Theory) and the Will Theory (or Choice Theory) of rights.

These are two of the most influential theories in the philosophy of rights, and they offer fundamentally different answers to the question:Â What does it mean to have a right?

### At a Glance: Core Difference

-   Interest Theory:Â A right protects aÂ fundamental interestÂ of the right-holder. The essence of a right is theÂ benefitÂ it secures.

-   Will Theory:Â A right is aÂ domain of sovereign choice. The essence of a right is theÂ power and controlÂ it gives the right-holder over another's duty.

### Detailed Comparison Table

| Feature | Interest Theory (Benefit Theory) | Will Theory (Choice Theory) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Idea | A right is constituted by theÂ interestÂ it protects. If X has a right, it is because the duty imposed on Y secures a fundamental benefit or interest of X. | A right is constituted by theÂ power of choiceÂ it confers. If X has a right, it is because X has the power to enforce or waive a duty imposed on Y. |
| Purpose of a Right | To promote theÂ well-beingÂ of the right-holder. | To secure theÂ freedom and autonomyÂ of the right-holder. |
| Relationship to Duty | Duty is primary. The right is theÂ beneficial outcomeÂ of that duty. | The right is primary. The duty is aÂ consequenceÂ of the right-holder's power to control it. |
| Key Proponents | Jeremy Bentham,Â Neil MacCormick,Â Joseph Raz | H.L.A. Hart,Â Hans Kelsen |
| Who Can Hold Rights? | Broad Scope.Â Any being that has interests can, in principle, hold rights. This easily includesÂ animals, infants, and comatose persons. | Narrow Scope.Â Only beings capable of conscious choice and exercising normative powers (e.g., waiving a duty) can hold rights. This typically excludesÂ animals, infants, and comatose persons. |
| View on Third-Party Beneficiaries | A third party who benefits from a duty (e.g., a child benefiting from a contract between A and B)Â can be said to have a right, as their interest is being protected. | A third party who benefits from a dutyÂ does not have a rightÂ unless they have the power to control (enforce/waive) that duty. They are mere beneficiaries. |
| Inalienable Rights | Easily Accommodated.Â An inalienable right is one that protects an interest so vital that it cannot be surrendered, even by the right-holder. | Problematic.Â If the essence of a right is the power to waive a duty, a right that cannot be waived seems like a contradiction. It denies the right-holder the very power that defines the right. |
| Criminal Law Example | Citizens have aÂ rightÂ not to be murdered. This right protects our fundamental interest in life. The state's duty to punish murderers exists to protect this interest, even if the victim's family forgives the murderer. | Citizens doÂ notÂ have a "right" in the will-theory sense against being murdered. The duty not to murder is imposed by the state, and the state, not the victim, chooses to enforce it. The victim, being dead, cannot waive or enforce the duty. |
| Contract Law Example | In a contract between A and B to pay money to C, CÂ has a rightÂ to the payment because it serves C's interest. | In the same contract, C is a mereÂ third-party beneficiaryÂ and has no right unless the contract gives C the legal power to sue for enforcement. |
