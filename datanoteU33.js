3.c.2 # Rationale Behind Professional Independence of Prosecutors

## INTRODUCTION: THE UNIQUE POSITION OF PROSECUTORS

Prosecutors occupy a distinctive and paradoxical position in the criminal justice system:

- They are **government officials** (part of the executive branch)
- Yet they must exercise **quasi-judicial discretion** (making decisions affecting liberty and rights)
- They wield **enormous power** (decision to prosecute or not can destroy lives)
- Yet they must act **impartially** in pursuit of justice, not merely convictions
- They represent **the state's interests** (law enforcement)
- Yet they have **duties to the accused** (disclosure of exculpatory evidence, fair prosecution)

This unique position creates the need for **prosecutorial independence**—the ability to make charging and prosecution decisions free from improper political, executive, or other external pressures, while remaining accountable to law and ethical standards.

---

## PART I: WHAT IS PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE?

### A. Defining Prosecutorial Independence

**Prosecutorial Independence Means:**

Prosecutorial independence refers to both individuals and institutions. On one hand, it is an individual state of mind that enables an individual prosecutor to make decisions rationally and impartially on the basis of the law and the evidence, without external pressure or influence and without fear of interference.

**Two Dimensions:**

#### **1. Individual Independence**
- Individual prosecutors can exercise discretion in specific cases
- Free from improper direction on whether to prosecute particular persons
- Decisions based on evidence and law, not politics or favoritism
- Professional judgment protected from interference

#### **2. Institutional Independence**
- Prosecution service as institution operates independently
- Not subject to executive control over individual prosecutions
- Protected from political manipulation
- Organizational autonomy in decision-making processes

### B. What Independence Does NOT Mean

**Prosecutorial Independence is NOT:**

❌ **Absolute autonomy** (prosecutors remain accountable)
❌ **Immunity from oversight** (accountability mechanisms must exist)
❌ **Freedom from legal constraints** (bound by law, ethics, procedure)
❌ **License for arbitrariness** (must follow prosecutorial guidelines)
❌ **Absence of review** (judicial review of prosecutorial actions possible)
❌ **Political neutrality of prosecution service** (prosecutors serve government, but independently)

### C. The Spectrum: Independence vs. Direction

**Different systems balance differently:**

**Maximum Independence Model (Career Prosecutors):**
- Prosecutors as independent civil service
- Minimal executive control
- Italy, Germany, some civil law systems
- Prosecutors have judicial-like status

**Intermediate Model:**
- Elected/appointed prosecutors with significant discretion
- General policy direction from executive
- No case-specific direction
- United States (federal), United Kingdom, Canada

**Executive Control Model:**
- Prosecutors as government lawyers
- Subject to executive direction
- Limited independent discretion
- Some developing countries

**Most democracies recognize that complete executive control is problematic, requiring at least functional independence in case decisions.**

## PART II: THE RATIONALE FOR PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE

### A. Constitutional and Rule of Law Foundations

#### **1. Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances**

**The Principle:**
The constitutional rules governing federal prosecutorial independence derive from the fundamental constitutional principle that all three branches must act independently before the federal government may punish someone for violating federal criminal law.

**Why This Matters:**

**Three Branches Must Act Separately:**
1. **Legislature** enacts criminal law (defines what is criminal)
2. **Executive** investigates and prosecutes (prosecutors are executive officials)
3. **Judiciary** adjudicates guilt and imposes sentence

**If executive controls prosecution too tightly:**
- Single branch (executive) effectively controls two functions (investigation/prosecution AND policy)
- Eliminates check on executive power
- Executive can shield its own officials from prosecution
- Can weaponize prosecution against opponents

**Prosecutorial Independence as Check:**
- Provides internal check within executive branch
- Prevents executive from manipulating criminal justice for political ends
- Ensures law is applied equally, including to government itself
- Protects rule of law from political manipulation

#### **2. Rule of Law and Equality Before the Law**

**Core Principle:**
Law must be applied **equally and impartially** to all persons, regardless of:
- Political connections
- Social status
- Wealth
- Government position
- Public opinion

**How Independence Serves This:**

**Without Independence:**
- Politically connected persons escape prosecution
- Opposition figures face selective prosecution
- Powerful interests dictate who is prosecuted
- Law becomes instrument of political power
- "One law for the rich, another for the poor"

**With Independence:**
- Prosecution decisions based on evidence and law
- No person is above the law (including government officials)
- No person is persecuted through law (including dissidents)
- Equality before law is meaningful, not merely formal
- Public confidence in impartial justice

**Example:**
- If government can direct prosecutors not to charge corrupt ministers, rule of law collapses
- If government can direct prosecutors to charge opposition leaders without evidence, authoritarian tool
- Independence prevents both abuses

#### **3. Protection of Fundamental Rights**

**The Power to Prosecute is Power to Destroy:**
- Criminal prosecution can:
  - Deprive liberty (imprisonment)
  - Destroy reputation (public accusation)
  - Bankrupt defendants (legal costs)
  - Ruin careers and families
  - Result in death penalty (where exists)

**Without Independence:**
- This enormous power becomes political weapon
- Dissidents, journalists, activists can be silenced through prosecution
- Opposition can be criminalized
- Fundamental freedoms (speech, association, political participation) undermined

**Independence as Rights Protection:**
- Ensures prosecution based on legal violations, not political opposition
- Protects freedom of speech (won't prosecute for political views)
- Protects freedom of association (won't prosecute based on group membership)
- Protects political participation (won't prosecute opposition politicians without genuine cause)
- **Prosecutorial independence is essential to democratic freedoms**

### B. Functional and Pragmatic Rationales

#### **1. Professional Expertise and Sound Judgment**

**Why Professional Judgment Matters:**

**Prosecutors as Legal Professionals:**
- Trained in law and evidence evaluation
- Understand criminal procedure and constitutional rights
- Experienced in determining whether cases are provable
- Know legal elements and standards of proof

**Politicians/Executive Officials Lack This:**
- Political leaders not trained in prosecution
- Motivated by political considerations, not legal merit
- May demand prosecution without adequate evidence
- May prevent prosecution for political reasons
- Don't understand legal sufficiency or trial dynamics

**Independence Ensures:**
- Charging decisions made by legal professionals
- Cases prosecuted only when evidence sufficient
- Weak cases not pursued (waste of resources, violate rights)
- Prosecutions based on likelihood of conviction, not political pressure

**Example:**
- Politician demands prosecution of opponent for "corruption"
- Independent prosecutor evaluates: Is there admissible evidence? What are elements of offense? Can we prove beyond reasonable doubt?
- If no, declines despite political pressure
- If yes, prosecutes despite political connection
- **Professional judgment prevails over political preference**

#### **2. Consistency and Predictability in Law Enforcement**

**The Problem of Politicized Prosecution:**
- If prosecutions follow political winds, enforcement is arbitrary
- Today's prosecuted conduct may be ignored tomorrow (and vice versa)
- Citizens cannot know what law requires
- Chilling effect on lawful conduct
- Breeds cynicism and disrespect for law

**Independence Creates Consistency:**
- Prosecution policies applied uniformly over time
- Similar cases treated similarly
- Precedents guide decisions
- Published prosecutorial guidelines provide transparency
- Public can predict what conduct will be prosecuted

**Institutional Memory:**
- Career prosecutors maintain consistency across political administrations
- Policies don't shift dramatically with each election
- Legal principles, not political priorities, guide decisions
- Stability in law enforcement

#### **3. Efficiency and Effectiveness of Criminal Justice**

**Focus on Crime, Not Politics:**

**With Political Control:**
- Prosecutors waste time on politically motivated cases
- Resources diverted to symbolic prosecutions
- Serious crimes neglected if politically inconvenient
- Public safety suffers

**With Independence:**
- Prosecutorial resources allocated based on crime priorities
- Focus on cases that can be proven and that serve justice
- Efficient use of limited resources
- Better crime control outcomes

**Evidence-Based Decision-Making:**
- Independent prosecutors develop expertise
- Make decisions based on evidence and precedent
- Learn from successes and failures
- Continuous professional improvement
- **Better outcomes for public safety**

#### **4. Public Confidence and Legitimacy**

**The Legitimacy Crisis:**

Prosecutorial independence ensures an important separation between politics and the criminal legal system necessary to create safer communities through a more just and equitable legal system.

**Why Public Trust Matters:**
- Criminal justice system requires public cooperation
- Citizens must report crimes, serve as witnesses, obey verdicts
- If system seen as politically manipulated, cooperation collapses
- If seen as fair and impartial, public supports and participates

**Independence Builds Trust:**
- Public believes prosecutions are based on evidence, not politics
- Convictions seen as legitimate, not political persecution
- Acquittals respected as fair outcomes
- System perceived as serving justice, not power
- **Social cohesion depends on perceived fairness of justice system**

**Distrust from Politicization:**
- If prosecution seen as political tool, legitimacy collapses
- Convictions seen as show trials
- Acquittals seen as evidence of corruption
- System loses deterrent effect
- Violence may replace legal process

### C. Protection from Specific Abuses

#### **1. Preventing Selective Prosecution**

**Selective Prosecution:**
Prosecuting Person A for conduct that is routinely ignored when Person B does it, based on improper motives (political affiliation, race, religion, speech).

**Why Problematic:**
- Violates equal protection
- Chills constitutional rights
- Transforms prosecution into political weapon
- Undermines legitimacy of convictions

**How Independence Prevents:**
- Charging decisions based on neutral factors (strength of evidence, seriousness, criminal history)
- Not based on political identity or views
- Published guidelines ensure uniformity
- Oversight mechanisms detect patterns of selectivity
- **Independence makes selective prosecution more difficult**

**Example:**
- Government wants to prosecute opposition journalists for "national security violations"
- Independent prosecutor evaluates: Are government journalists prosecuted for similar conduct? Is evidence strong? Is this viewpoint discrimination?
- Can decline prosecution if selective
- Or demand equal treatment of government-aligned media

#### **2. Preventing Vindictive Prosecution**

**Vindictive Prosecution:**
Prosecuting someone because they exercised legal rights (appeal, speech, political opposition).

**Why Problematic:**
- Chills constitutional rights
- Punishes legal conduct
- Abuse of prosecutorial power
- Transforms prosecution into revenge tool

**How Independence Prevents:**
- Prosecutors guided by professional ethics, not vindictiveness
- Must show legitimate prosecutorial reason for timing/charges
- Cannot increase charges in retaliation for exercising rights
- Judicial review available for vindictive prosecution claims
- **Professional independence reduces vindictive prosecution risk**

#### **3. Preventing Corrupt Bargains**

**The Risk:**
Without independence, executives can offer "deals":
- Don't prosecute my allies, and I'll appoint you to higher position
- Prosecute my enemies, and I'll increase your budget
- Look the other way on this corruption, and your family will benefit

**Independence as Corruption Prevention:**
- Prosecutors have secure tenure (can't be fired for one decision)
- Career advancement not dependent on pleasing politicians
- Ethical rules prohibit conflicts of interest
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Internal review and oversight
- **Structural independence reduces corruption opportunities**

#### **4. Protecting Unpopular but Legally Correct Decisions**

**The Challenge:**
Sometimes law requires:
- Prosecuting popular figures
- Not prosecuting unpopular figures (if insufficient evidence)
- Applying unpopular laws
- Not applying laws when unconstitutional

**Without Independence:**
- Prosecutor caves to public/political pressure
- Popular defendants escape justice
- Unpopular defendants are railroaded
- Law application becomes mob rule

**With Independence:**
- Prosecutor can make unpopular but legally correct decision
- Protected from political retaliation
- Can explain decision based on law and evidence
- **Independence enables courage to follow law despite pressure**

**Example:**
- Highly publicized case, public demands prosecution
- But evidence is weak, conviction unlikely
- Independent prosecutor can decline despite outcry
- Explains: "We cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt"
- Public may disagree, but decision is legally sound

---

## PART III: ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE INDEPENDENCE PARADOX

### A. The Central Tension

**The Paradox:**
- Prosecutors need independence to resist improper pressure
- BUT prosecutors also wield enormous power that can be abused
- Independence without accountability = tyranny
- Accountability without independence = politicization

**The Challenge:**
**How to ensure prosecutors are independent from improper political control while remaining accountable for abuse of power, incompetence, or corruption?**

### B. Forms of Accountability (Compatible with Independence)

#### **1. Legal Accountability**

**Rule of Law Constraints:**
- Prosecutors bound by criminal law (what is prosecutable)
- Bound by criminal procedure (how to prosecute)
- Bound by constitutional law (rights of accused)
- Bound by evidence law (what can be used)

**Judicial Review:**
- Courts review prosecutorial decisions in various contexts:
  - Preliminary hearings (probable cause)
  - Trial (sufficiency of evidence)
  - Motions to dismiss (legal sufficiency)
  - Appeals (procedural errors, misconduct)
  - Writs (abuse of discretion, malicious prosecution)
- Judicial review checks prosecutorial power without controlling prosecutorial discretion

**Legal Liability:**
- Prosecutors can be sued for malicious prosecution (if acted outside role)
- Subject to contempt for violating court orders
- Criminal liability for corruption or obstruction of justice
- **But: Prosecutorial immunity for official acts protects independence**

#### **2. Ethical Accountability**

**Professional Ethics Rules:**
- Bar association rules govern prosecutors
- Duty to seek justice, not merely convictions
- Duty to disclose exculpatory evidence
- Duty not to prosecute without probable cause
- Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
- Duty not to make inflammatory statements

**Disciplinary Mechanisms:**
- Bar associations can discipline prosecutors
- Sanctions: reprimand, suspension, disbarment
- Based on professional standards, not political considerations
- Independent bar review protects both independence and accountability

#### **3. Internal Accountability (Prosecutorial Office)**

**Hierarchical Review:**
- Senior prosecutors review junior prosecutors' decisions
- Ensures consistency and quality
- Provides guidance and training
- Corrects errors before they become public

**Internal Guidelines:**
- Written prosecutorial guidelines
- Charging standards
- Plea bargaining policies
- Case prioritization criteria
- Ensures uniform application of prosecutorial discretion

**Peer Review:**
- Other prosecutors review significant decisions
- Collective deliberation on difficult cases
- Prevents individual caprice
- Institutional checks on individual prosecutors

#### **4. Transparency and Public Accountability**

**Published Policies:**
- Prosecutorial offices publish charging policies
- Explain priorities and standards
- Public can evaluate whether applied consistently
- Media and civil society scrutiny

**Statistics and Reporting:**
- Conviction rates
- Case outcomes
- Demographic data (to detect bias)
- Resource allocation
- Public transparency about performance

**Explaining Decisions:**
- Prosecutors explain significant charging decisions publicly
- Provide reasons for not prosecuting high-profile cases
- Build public understanding and confidence
- Distinguish from political justifications

**Example:**
"After thorough investigation, we determined evidence was insufficient to prove [crime] beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, [explanation of evidentiary gaps]. While we understand public disappointment, our legal and ethical duty is to prosecute only when we can prove guilt, not based on suspicion or public pressure."

#### **5. Democratic Accountability (Indirect)**

**Electoral Accountability (Where Applicable):**
- Some systems elect chief prosecutors (US District Attorneys)
- Public can vote out prosecutors they disapprove of
- Provides democratic accountability
- BUT: Can also create political pressure to prosecute based on popularity rather than evidence

**Legislative Oversight:**
- Legislatures can:
  - Set prosecutorial budgets
  - Enact laws defining prosecutorial powers
  - Hold hearings on prosecutorial practices
  - Change laws if prosecutors not enforcing them
- Oversight of institution, not control of individual cases
- **General policy oversight compatible with case-level independence**

#### **6. Institutional Accountability (Prosecution Councils/Commissions)**

**Independent Oversight Bodies:**
- Some jurisdictions create independent councils
- Composed of judges, lawyers, civil society members
- Review complaints against prosecutors
- Investigate serious misconduct
- Impose sanctions or make recommendations
- **External oversight without executive control**

**Model:**
- Judicial Appointments and Conduct Commissions (for judges)
- Similar bodies for prosecutors ensure accountability
- Independence from executive protects prosecutorial independence
- Transparency and diverse membership ensures accountability

### C. Balancing Independence and Accountability

**The Right Balance:**

**Maximum Independence for:**
- **Individual case decisions** (whether to prosecute specific person)
- **Charging decisions** (what charges to bring)
- **Plea bargaining** (what deals to offer)
- **Trial conduct** (what evidence to present)
- **Appeals** (whether to appeal acquittals where permitted)

**Legitimate Accountability for:**
- **General policies** (what types of crimes to prioritize)
- **Resource allocation** (how to deploy limited resources)
- **Professional competence** (meeting ethical standards)
- **Corruption/misconduct** (abuse of office)
- **Outcomes** (conviction rates, case backlog, justice served)

**The Principle:**
**No direction on WHO to prosecute or not prosecute (independence)**
**Yes accountability for HOW prosecution function is performed (accountability)**

---

## PART IV: CHALLENGES TO PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE

### A. Structural Challenges

#### **1. Executive Appointment and Control**

**The Problem:**
- In most systems, prosecutors are appointed by executive branch
- Report to Attorney General or Minister of Justice
- Budgets controlled by executive
- Career advancement depends on executive favor

**The Risk:**
- Prosecutors may self-censor to please political masters
- Fear of dismissal or retaliation inhibits independence
- Subtle pressure through appointments, transfers, promotions
- Culture of compliance rather than independence

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Secure tenure (fixed terms, removal only for cause)
- Civil service protection
- Independent appointments commissions
- Transparent performance evaluation
- Whistleblower protections

#### **2. Political Pressure and Public Opinion**

**Sources of Pressure:**
- Media campaigns demanding prosecution/non-prosecution
- Public protests and demonstrations
- Political statements criticizing prosecutors
- Social media attacks
- Threats to personal safety

**Why Problematic:**
- Prosecutors are human and feel pressure
- May compromise independence to avoid criticism
- May prosecute weak cases to satisfy public opinion
- May decline strong cases if politically unpopular
- **Public pressure substitutes for legal judgment**

**Protecting Against:**
- Institutional support for prosecutors facing pressure
- Public education about prosecutorial role
- Clear ethical guidelines on responding to pressure
- Security measures when needed
- Culture of prosecutorial courage

#### **3. Relationship with Police/Investigators**

**The Challenge:**
- Prosecutors depend on police for investigation
- Police may have political pressures
- Police may bring weak cases
- Prosecutors may rubber-stamp police decisions

**Independence Requires:**
- Prosecutors can direct investigations (in some systems)
- Prosecutors can reject weak cases from police
- Prosecutors evaluate evidence independently
- Not merely advocates for police position
- **Professional judgment independent from police pressure**

#### **4. Resource Constraints and Priorities**

**The Dilemma:**
- Prosecutors have limited resources
- Cannot prosecute every violation
- Must prioritize
- But who sets priorities?

**Balancing:**
- **Policy-level prioritization** (executive can set general priorities: focus on violent crime, corruption, etc.)
- **Case-level decisions** (prosecutors decide which specific cases meet priorities)
- **Transparency** about prioritization criteria
- **No case-specific direction** (executive cannot say "prosecute Person X" or "don't prosecute Person Y")

### B. Challenges in Specific Contexts

#### **1. Prosecuting Government Officials**

**The Ultimate Test:**
When prosecutor must decide whether to charge current government officials (including superiors).

**Without Independence:**
- Prosecutors shield government from accountability
- Corruption flourishes
- Public loses faith in equal justice
- "Above the law" culture develops

**With Independence:**
- Prosecutors can investigate and charge government officials
- Even if prosecutors appointed by those officials
- **Independence protects democracy from corruption**

**Examples:**
- Corruption by cabinet ministers
- Police brutality
- Election fraud
- Abuse of power

**Special Protections Needed:**
- Cannot fire prosecutor for investigating government
- Independent investigators for government cases
- Special prosecutors or independent commissions
- Media and civil society oversight
- International pressure where appropriate

#### **2. National Security and Terrorism Cases**

**Special Pressure:**
- Government claims national security requires prosecution/non-prosecution
- Public fear and anger after terrorist attacks
- Classified evidence
- Executive claims special expertise

**Independence Challenges:**
- Pressure to prosecute based on suspicion, not evidence
- Pressure to use illegal evidence or procedures
- Pressure to preventively detain without trial
- **Fear used to override legal standards**

**Maintaining Independence:**
- Even in national security cases, legal standards apply
- Prosecutors must evaluate evidence, not government claims
- Constitutional rights don't disappear in crisis
- **Independence especially important when stakes are highest**

#### **3. Prosecuting Corporations and Economic Elites**

**Special Challenges:**
- Corporate defendants have enormous resources
- Can hire expensive legal teams
- May have political connections
- Media campaigns against prosecution
- Economic arguments (jobs, stock market)

**Independence Requires:**
- Prosecutorial decisions based on law, not economic power
- Treating corporate crime seriously
- Not declining prosecution due to defendant's resources
- Not accepting weak plea deals due to defendant's lawyers
- **Equal justice regardless of wealth**

# 3.c.2 The Prosecutor's Dilemmas: Ethics, Duty, and Exceptional Challenges
## A Guide to the Moral and Practical Challenges of Prosecution

---

## INTRODUCTION: The Unique Position of the Prosecutor

The prosecutor occupies one of the most ethically complex positions in the criminal justice system. Unlike defense counsel (whose duty is zealous advocacy for the client) or judges (whose duty is impartial adjudication), **the prosecutor has a dual and sometimes conflicting mandate:**

1. **Minister of Justice**: Duty to ensure justice, not merely to convict
2. **Representative of the State**: Duty to prosecute crime and protect society

This dual role creates inherent tensions that manifest as daily dilemmas and occasional extraordinary crises.

## PART I: REGULAR DILEMMAS IN DAILY PRACTICE

### A. THE CHARGING DECISION DILEMMA

#### Dilemma 1: Sufficient Evidence vs. Probable Guilt

**The Situation:**
- You have *legally sufficient* evidence to file charges (meets threshold)
- But you personally believe the accused is *probably innocent*
- The evidence is weak, circumstantial, or based on unreliable witnesses
- But technically, it meets the minimum standard

**The Conflict:**
- **Legal duty**: If evidence meets threshold, you can proceed
- **Ethical duty**: Should you prosecute someone you believe innocent?
- **Institutional pressure**: Superiors/police expect filing
- **Public pressure**: Victim's family demands prosecution
- **Career pressure**: Your conviction rate matters

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: The Dubious Identification**
- Victim identifies accused in lineup
- But conditions were poor (dark, brief, traumatic)
- Accused has alibi (not airtight but plausible)
- No other corroborating evidence
- Legally sufficient? Yes. Probably guilty? Uncertain.

**What do you do?**

**Scenario B: The Pressured Confession**
- Accused confessed during interrogation
- Confession is admissible (no legal violation)
- But you've reviewed the video: interrogation was aggressive, accused seemed confused, possibly coerced though not illegally
- Other evidence is weak
- Confession alone could convict

**What do you do?**

**The Prosecutor's Burden:**
You cannot simply pass the buck to the court ("Let the judge/jury decide"). You are the gatekeeper. Filing charges has serious consequences:
- Accused's reputation destroyed
- Legal costs (even if acquitted)
- Stress, trauma, loss of employment
- Jail time if unable to post bail

**Guiding Principles:**

**The Justice Standard**: Don't prosecute unless you genuinely believe:
1. The accused is guilty (not just "might be")
2. You can prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt
3. Prosecution serves justice, not just process

**The Berger Principle** (*Berger v. United States*, 295 U.S. 78):
> "The [prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done."

**Practical Test:**
- Would you prosecute if this were your family member accused?
- If your answer differs based on relationship, examine your reasoning carefully
- Justice must be blind to relationship, but your human intuition about guilt/innocence is valuable

---

#### Dilemma 2: Overcharging vs. Undercharging

**The Situation:**
Facts support multiple charges of varying severity. How do you decide?

**Option A: Maximum Charges**
- File every possible charge
- Increases sentencing exposure
- Creates "bargaining chips" for plea negotiation
- Ensures nothing is missed

**Option B: Appropriate Charges**
- File only charges you believe fit the conduct
- More ethical, less coercive
- But limits flexibility in plea bargaining
- May be seen as "soft"

**The Pressures:**

**Toward Overcharging:**
- Institutional practice ("everyone does it")
- Plea bargaining system expects it
- Victims want maximum accountability
- Media/public outcry in high-profile cases
- Political pressure from superiors

**Toward Undercharging:**
- Ethical concerns about coercion
- Resource limitations (trial capacity)
- Desire for quick disposition
- Sympathy for accused's circumstances

**The Ethical Problem:**
Overcharging as a "negotiating tactic" treats criminal law as a game. It coerces guilty pleas through fear rather than actual guilt. The accused faces:
- Decades in prison if convicted at trial (overcharged)
- vs. Months/years if they plead guilty (appropriate charge)

**This isn't a fair choice—it's coercion.**

**Example:**
- Defendant punched someone in bar fight, causing minor injury
- Could charge: Attempt to Murder, Aggravated Assault, Simple Assault, Battery
- Attempt to Murder is legally supportable (punch *could* kill) but morally absurd
- Yet charging it creates massive pressure to plead to Simple Assault

**Guiding Principle:**
**Charge what you believe fits the conduct, not what maximizes leverage.**

If you wouldn't seek that conviction at trial, you shouldn't charge it.

---

#### Dilemma 3: "Technical" Violations vs. Substantial Justice

**The Situation:**
Accused violated the letter of the law, but:
- No harm resulted
- No criminal intent evident
- Prosecution seems disproportionate
- Resources could be better spent

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The Expired License**
- Accused drove with license expired by 3 days
- Otherwise perfect record
- No accident, no harm
- Technically, driving without valid license

**Scenario B: The Old Warrant**
- 20-year-old warrant for minor offense
- Accused has reformed completely since then
- Model citizen for two decades
- Warrant resurfaces during routine check

**Scenario C: The Technical Violation**
- Sex offender registration: Moved apartments, notified within 5 days instead of required 3 days
- No intent to evade, was confused about timing
- Full compliance otherwise
- Violation could mean years in prison

**The Conflict:**
- **Law-and-order principle**: Law is law; violate it, face consequences
- **Justice principle**: Prosecution should serve purpose, not just process
- **Resource principle**: Limited resources should target serious crime
- **Deterrence principle**: Enforcing technical violations deters future violations

**What do you do?**

**Guiding Principles:**

**Proportionality**: Does the prosecution fit the seriousness of the violation?

**Mens Rea**: Was there criminal intent, or innocent mistake?

**Harm**: Did anyone suffer actual harm?

**Reform**: Has the accused demonstrated rehabilitation?

**Deterrence**: Is prosecution necessary to deter others?

**Resources**: Is this the best use of limited prosecutorial resources?

**Consider:** Alternative dispositions (warning, diversion, civil penalty)

---

### B. THE EVIDENCE DILEMMA

#### Dilemma 4: Weak but Admissible Evidence

**The Situation:**
- Evidence is legally admissible
- But you know it's unreliable, misleading, or problematic
- Using it could lead to wrongful conviction
- Not using it might lead to acquittal of guilty person

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The "Junk Science"**
- Expert testimony on bite marks, blood spatter, hair comparison
- Admissible under current standards
- But scientific consensus has debunked these methods
- Expert is credible-sounding, jury will likely believe

**Do you use it?**

**Scenario B: The Unreliable Eyewitness**
- Witness is confident in identification
- But you know eyewitness memory is notoriously unreliable
- Cross-race identification, stressful circumstances, long delay
- Legally admissible, likely persuasive to jury

**Do you present it?**

**Scenario C: The Jailhouse Informant**
- Cellmate claims accused confessed
- You know jailhouse informants often lie for deals
- This one has incentive (sentence reduction pending)
- But confession contains details that seem credible

**Do you call this witness?**

**The Ethical Standard:**

**ABA Model Rule 3.8**: Prosecutor has special responsibilities to ensure justice

**Brady v. Maryland**: Duty to disclose exculpatory evidence

**But what about duty NOT to use unreliable inculpatory evidence?**

**Guiding Principle:**
Just because evidence is *admissible* doesn't mean you should use it.

Ask yourself:
- Is this evidence actually reliable?
- Could it mislead the jury?
- Would I want this used against me or my family member?
- Does using this serve justice or just win the case?

**The Hard Truth:**
If you use evidence you know is unreliable, and it leads to wrongful conviction, **you bear moral responsibility even if legally you did nothing wrong.**

---

#### Dilemma 5: Disclosure Obligations vs. Strategic Advantage

**The Situation:**
You have evidence that:
- Might be exculpatory (Brady material)
- Or might be neutral
- Or might be inculpatory but defense could spin it as exculpatory
- Unclear whether disclosure is legally required

**The Temptation:**
- When in doubt, don't disclose
- Let defense discover it on their own (or not)
- Maintain strategic advantage
- "I didn't think it was material"

**The Conflict:**
- **Legal minimum**: Disclose only what Brady clearly requires
- **Ethical maximum**: Disclose anything that could possibly help defense
- **Practical concern**: Over-disclosure buries defense in irrelevant material
- **Strategic concern**: Disclosure helps defense prepare counter-narrative

**Example:**

**The Inconsistent Witness Statement:**
- Your key witness gave 3 statements to police
- First two: Vague, inconsistent details
- Third: Crystal clear, detailed (this is what you'll use at trial)
- First two are technically "prior inconsistent statements"
- Must you disclose them?

**Legally**: Probably yes (impeachment material under *Brady/Giglio*)

**But prosecutors often rationalize:**
- "They're not actually inconsistent, just less detailed"
- "Defense can get them through discovery if they ask"
- "These aren't exculpatory, just less inculpatory"

**The Risk:**
If you hide them and they come out (and they often do), you:
- Face potential *Brady* violation
- Lose credibility with court
- Risk mistrial or reversal
- Potentially enable wrongful conviction

**Guiding Principle:**

**"Open File" Approach**: When in doubt, disclose.

Better to disclose too much than too little. Your duty is justice, not conviction.

**The Test:**
If this evidence came out after conviction, would you feel comfortable defending your decision not to disclose?

If answer is no → disclose.

---

#### Dilemma 6: Discovering Evidence of Innocence Mid-Trial

**The Situation:**
- Trial is ongoing
- You've presented your case
- New evidence emerges suggesting accused is innocent
- Or your witness admits they lied
- Or exculpatory evidence you didn't know about surfaces

**The Conflict:**
- **Duty to justice**: You must act on this immediately
- **Institutional momentum**: Trial is in progress, jury is deliberating
- **Ego/reputation**: Admitting error publicly
- **Career pressure**: This will look bad

**What You MUST Do (Legally and Ethically):**

1. **Immediately disclose to defense and court**
2. **If sufficiently exculpatory, move for dismissal**
3. **If conviction has occurred, support motion to vacate**
4. **Do not rationalize or minimize**

**Famous Example:**
**Mike Nifong (Duke Lacrosse Case)**:
- Prosecutor suppressed DNA evidence excluding defendants
- Proceeded with prosecution despite knowing innocence
- Result: Disbarment, criminal contempt conviction
- His name is now synonymous with prosecutorial misconduct

**Counter-Example:**
**Prosecutors who've dismissed cases upon discovering innocence:**
- Quietly recognized, not celebrated
- But sleep well at night
- Maintained integrity

**The Test:**
What will you tell your children you did when you discovered you were prosecuting an innocent person?

---

### C. THE PLEA BARGAINING DILEMMA

#### Dilemma 7: Coercive Plea Offers

**The Situation:**
Standard practice is offering significant sentencing discount for guilty plea:
- Plead guilty: 2 years
- Go to trial: 20 years (if convicted)

**The Problem:**
- This 10x differential coerces pleas
- Even innocent defendants plead guilty to avoid risk
- System processes people, doesn't determine truth
- But if you offer "fair" deals, you have no leverage, cases go to trial, system collapses

**The Reality:**
- 95%+ of criminal cases resolve via plea
- System depends on this coercion
- Trials are the exception, not the norm
- You are a cog in this machine

**The Ethical Question:**
Are you comfortable being an instrument of a system that coerces pleas through fear?

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The Probably Innocent Defendant**
- Accused charged with assault
- Evidence is weak, you have doubts
- Accused can't make bail, has been in jail 6 months awaiting trial
- Trial is scheduled 4 months out (10 months total)
- You offer: Plead to time served, go home today
- vs. Trial: Risk 5 years if convicted

**Accused is probably innocent. But if they go to trial and lose, they get 5 years. If they plead guilty, they go home today.**

**What would you do in their shoes?**

Most plead guilty. You've just coerced a false confession.

**How do you live with this?**

**Scenario B: The Mandatory Minimum**
- Drug charge carries 10-year mandatory minimum
- Accused is low-level dealer, not kingpin
- 10 years is grossly disproportionate
- You can offer plea to lesser charge: 2 years
- But if accused goes to trial and loses, you MUST seek 10 years

**You disagree with the mandatory minimum. But it's the law.**

**Do you:**
- Use it as leverage to coerce plea?
- Refuse to use unjust law as bargaining chip?
- Reduce charges to avoid triggering mandatory minimum?

**Guiding Principles:**

**Proportionality**: Offer should reflect what you actually believe is just sentence

**Consistency**: Would you offer same deal to rich defendant with expensive lawyer?

**Honesty**: Don't threaten charges you wouldn't actually pursue

**Justice over Efficiency**: System's need for pleas doesn't override justice

**The Hard Truth:**
You are part of a fundamentally coercive system. You can either:
1. Accept this and participate
2. Try to mitigate it through fair offers
3. Leave prosecution

**There's no fully ethical answer within the system as structured.**

---

#### Dilemma 8: Victim vs. Justice

**The Situation:**
- Victim demands maximum prosecution
- But you believe lesser charge/sentence is appropriate
- Or you believe prosecution isn't warranted at all

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The Exaggerated Harm**
- Victim claims severe trauma from incident
- Evidence suggests incident was minor
- Victim is clearly exaggerating (perhaps for civil lawsuit)
- But victim is sympathetic, credible-seeming

**Do you:**
- Prosecute to satisfy victim?
- Decline/reduce because victim is exaggerating?

**Scenario B: Domestic Violence - Victim Recants**
- Initial 911 call: Clear assault, victim terrified
- By the time of trial: Victim recants, says she lied, wants charges dropped
- You believe (based on experience) she's being coerced/manipulated by abuser
- But she's competent, insists she wants case dismissed

**Do you:**
- Proceed against victim's wishes (for her "own good")?
- Dismiss, respecting her autonomy?

**Scenario C: Victim Wants Revenge, Not Justice**
- Victim wants accused to "rot in jail"
- Motivated by revenge, not justice
- Demands you seek maximum sentence
- But proportionality suggests lesser sentence appropriate

**The Conflict:**
- **Victim's rights movement**: Victims deserve voice, consideration
- **Justice principle**: Victim's preferences don't dictate prosecution
- **Practical concern**: Victim cooperation often necessary for conviction
- **Ethical concern**: Criminal law serves society, not individual vengeance

**Guiding Principles:**

**Victim Input ≠ Victim Control**: Listen to victim, but YOU decide what justice requires

**Explain Your Reasoning**: If you diverge from victim's wishes, explain why

**Separate Emotions from Facts**: Victim's understandable anger doesn't dictate appropriate charge/sentence

**The Berger Principle Again**: Your client is justice, not the victim

**The Hard Conversation:**
"I understand you want [maximum charge]. But based on [evidence/law], the appropriate charge is [lesser]. I know this is frustrating, but my duty is to do justice, not to maximize punishment."

**Be prepared:** Victim may complain to your supervisor, media, politicians. Stand firm if you're right.

---

### D. THE WITNESS MANAGEMENT DILEMMA

#### Dilemma 9: The Lying Witness

**The Situation:**
- Your witness is lying (or you strongly suspect they are)
- Perhaps exaggerating
- Perhaps omitting key facts
- Perhaps fabricating entirely

**What You Cannot Do (Legally):**
- Knowingly present perjured testimony
- Suborn perjury
- Allow false testimony to stand uncorrected

**What You Must Do:**
- If you *know* witness will lie, you cannot call them
- If witness lies on stand and you discover it, you must correct it

**The Gray Areas:**

**Scenario A: The Witness You Suspect (But Don't Know) Is Lying**
- Witness's story has evolved
- Details seem too perfect
- But no proof of lying
- Witness insists story is true

**Can you call this witness?**

**Legally**: Yes (you don't "know" they're lying)

**Ethically**: Should you?

**Scenario B: The Witness Who "Remembers Better" After Prep**
- First interview: Vague, uncertain
- After multiple prep sessions: Crystal clear, confident
- You've helped them "remember"
- Line between legitimate prep and creating false memory?

**Have you crossed a line?**

**Scenario C: The Witness Who Lies About Peripheral Matters**
- Core testimony is true (you believe)
- But lies about peripheral details (to make themselves look better, hide embarrassing facts)
- The lies aren't material to the case

**Do you call them? Do you correct the peripheral lies?**

**Guiding Principles:**

**The Bright Line**: If you KNOW testimony is false (core or peripheral), you cannot present it

**The Gray Zone**: If you suspect but don't know, you can call witness BUT:
- Don't coach them toward the false version
- Don't elicit testimony you believe is false
- If they volunteer it, consider your duty to correct

**Witness Preparation vs. Fabrication**:
- **Proper**: Helping witness organize truthful memories, prepare for cross-examination, understand court procedures
- **Improper**: Suggesting "better" memories, filling in gaps with suggestions, rehearsing testimony to the point of artificial perfection

**The Test:**
Are you helping the witness testify truthfully, or creating false testimony?

**If discovered, would you be comfortable defending your witness prep methods?**

---

#### Dilemma 10: The Immunized Witness / Cooperating Co-Defendant

**The Situation:**
- You need Witness A's testimony to convict Defendant B
- Witness A is also culpable (often more culpable than B)
- You must offer immunity/leniency to A to get B

**The Problem:**
- You're letting the bigger fish go to catch the smaller fish
- Or you're letting an equally guilty person skate
- The cooperating witness is often unreliable (motivated by self-interest)
- But this is how you build cases against organizations, conspiracies

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The Snitch Who's Worse**
- Drug conspiracy: Boss (A) and lieutenant (B)
- Boss offers to testify against lieutenant for immunity
- Boss is more culpable, but lieutenant won't cooperate
- Do you give the boss immunity to convict the lieutenant?

**Scenario B: The Cooperator Who Minimizes Own Role**
- Co-defendants in robbery: A and B
- A agrees to cooperate
- A's testimony minimizes A's role, maximizes B's role
- You suspect A is lying about respective culpability
- But A's testimony is necessary to convict B

**Do you use it?**

**Scenario C: The Serial Cooperator**
- Informant has testified in 10 previous cases (always gets deals)
- Has incentive to fabricate to keep getting deals
- Current testimony seems credible
- But pattern suggests unreliability

**Do you call this witness? Do you disclose the pattern to defense?**

**Guiding Principles:**

**Disclosure**: MUST disclose any promises, deals, or expectations of benefit (*Giglio*)

**Verify Independently**: Don't rely solely on cooperator's testimony

**Proportionality**: The deal to cooperator should reflect their actual culpability

**Candor to Court**: Don't oversell cooperator's credibility

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**
The criminal justice system depends on cooperators, many of whom are unreliable. You must use them, but use them ethically.

---

### E. THE SYSTEMIC PRESSURE DILEMMA

#### Dilemma 11: Conviction Rate Pressure

**The Situation:**
- Your office tracks conviction rates
- Your career advancement depends on "wins"
- You're evaluated on numbers, not justice
- Pressure to avoid "losers" (cases you might lose)

**The Distortions:**

1. **Cherry-Picking**: Only prosecuting slam-dunk cases
2. **Overcharging**: To coerce pleas (counted as convictions)
3. **Avoiding Righteous Acquittals**: Not dismissing weak cases because it looks like "loss"
4. **Risk Aversion**: Not prosecuting powerful/wealthy defendants (harder to convict)

**The Problem:**
If you're evaluated on conviction rate, you're incentivized to:
- Prosecute easy cases against poor defendants
- Avoid hard cases against powerful defendants
- Coerce pleas rather than trial
- Never dismiss even when justice requires it

**This is opposite of what justice requires.**

**What Do You Do?**

**Options:**

**Option A: Play the Game**
- Maintain high conviction rate
- Advance career
- Compromise ethics

**Option B: Prioritize Justice**
- Take hard cases
- Dismiss when appropriate
- Accept lower conviction rate
- Risk career stagnation

**Option C: Try to Change the System**
- Advocate for different metrics
- Build coalition with like-minded prosecutors
- Accept short-term career risk for long-term reform

**There's no easy answer.** But know this:

**A high conviction rate at the cost of justice is not an accomplishment—it's a moral failure.**

---

#### Dilemma 12: Political Pressure

**The Situation:**
- High-profile case
- Politicians, media, public demanding prosecution
- Or demanding you NOT prosecute (if defendant is connected)
- Your evaluation of case doesn't match political pressure

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The Politically Connected Defendant**
- Defendant is wealthy donor, politician's friend, influential figure
- Strong evidence of crime
- You receive "friendly advice" to decline prosecution
- Or to offer sweetheart plea deal

**Do you:**
- Treat like any other case (and face career consequences)?
- Bow to pressure?

**Scenario B: The Public Outcry Case**
- High-profile incident (police shooting, hate crime, etc.)
- Massive public pressure to prosecute
- But evidence is weak/problematic
- You believe charges aren't warranted, but public wants "accountability"

**Do you:**
- File charges you don't believe in?
- Decline and face firestorm?

**Scenario C: The Election Year**
- Your DA is up for re-election
- Policy shifts toward more aggressive prosecution
- Cases you'd normally decline, you're now told to file
- "Tough on crime" posturing

**Do you:**
- Go along with politicized prosecution?
- Push back and risk your position?

**Guiding Principle:**

**Your oath is to justice, not to politicians.**

Easy to say. Hard to live.

**Practical Reality:**
- Prosecutors serve at pleasure of elected DA
- DAs respond to political pressures
- You may not have autonomy to resist

**What You Can Do:**
- Document your recommendations in writing
- If overruled, create paper trail
- Consider whether you can ethically continue in that office
- In extreme cases, whistleblow or resign

**The Test:**
Years from now, how will you explain your decision?
- "I filed charges I knew were wrong because my boss told me to"?
- "I stood firm on principle, even though it cost me"?

**Which prosecutor do you want to have been?**

---

## PART II: EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS

### A. DISCOVERING INNOCENCE POST-CONVICTION

#### Exceptional Situation 1: You Convicted an Innocent Person

**The Situation:**
- Years after conviction, new evidence emerges
- Or witness recants
- Or DNA excludes defendant
- Or you review the case and realize: "We got the wrong person"

**The Conflict:**
- **Duty to justice**: Innocent person is in prison
- **Institutional inertia**: Conviction is final, appeals exhausted
- **Ego/reputation**: Admitting you were wrong
- **Career risk**: Acknowledging error
- **Psychological defense**: Rationalizing ("maybe they're still guilty of something")

**What You MUST Do:**

**1. Acknowledge the Reality**
Don't rationalize. If evidence shows innocence, accept it.

**2. Investigate Thoroughly**
Review the entire case fresh. What did you miss?

**3. Disclose Immediately**
To defense, to court, to Conviction Integrity Unit (if exists)

**4. Support Exoneration**
Join motion to vacate conviction
Recommend release
Don't fight the inevitable

**5. Investigate the Systemic Failure**
How did this happen? What reforms are needed?

**Famous Examples:**

**Good:** Prosecutors who've joined exoneration efforts:
- Recognized wrongful conviction
- Supported defendant's release
- Helped identify actual perpetrator
- Advocated for reforms

**Bad:** Prosecutors who fight exoneration despite clear evidence:
- Defending conviction at all costs
- Technical procedural arguments
- "He's probably guilty of something else"
- Decades of fighting obvious innocence

**Which would you be?**

**The Personal Toll:**
This will haunt you. You put an innocent person in prison. No way to fully atone.

**But:**
- Acting swiftly to correct limits the harm
- Honest acknowledgment has integrity
- System-wide reforms prevent future wrongful convictions
- Your conscience can eventually find peace

**If you fight the exoneration:**
- The innocent person stays imprisoned longer
- You become complicit in ongoing injustice
- Your conscience will give you no peace
- History will judge you harshly

---

#### Exceptional Situation 2: Discovering Misconduct by Police/Prior Prosecutor

**The Situation:**
- You inherit a case or review old conviction
- You discover:
  - Police fabricated evidence
  - Prior prosecutor withheld exculpatory evidence
  - Witness was coerced
  - Confession was tortured

**The Conflict:**
- **Duty to justice**: Must correct
- **Institutional loyalty**: Don't "rat out" colleagues
- **Career risk**: Being labeled a traitor
- **Practical concern**: Undermines other cases by same officers/prosecutors

**What You MUST Do:**

**1. Document Everything**
Create detailed record of what you found

**2. Report Internally**
To supervisor, to DA, to Conviction Integrity Unit

**3. If Internal Reporting Fails:**
Consider external reporting (judicial misconduct board, Inspector General, etc.)

**4. Support Defendant's Rights**
Join motion to vacate if appropriate

**5. Systemic Response**
- Review other cases by same officer/prosecutor
- Implement reforms to prevent recurrence

**The Blue Wall / Prosecutorial Solidarity:**

Pressure to protect "the team" is immense.

**But your duty is to justice, not to corrupt colleagues.**

**Examples:**

**Good:** Prosecutors who've exposed misconduct:
- Reviewed cases by corrupt detective, overturned dozens of convictions
- Reported Brady violations by prior administration
- Supported systemic reforms

**Bad:** Prosecutors who covered up misconduct:
- Knew about systematic police brutality, stayed silent
- Discovered prior prosecutor's misconduct, buried it
- Protected corrupt colleague at cost of innocent defendants

**The Test:**
If this misconduct were directed at YOUR family member, would you want prosecutor to expose it or cover it up?

**Decide accordingly.**

---

### B. ETHICAL CRISES AND CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE

#### Exceptional Situation 3: Ordered to Prosecute Case You Believe is Unjust

**The Situation:**
- Your supervisor orders you to prosecute
- You believe:
  - Defendant is innocent, OR
  - Charges are inappropriate/excessive, OR
  - Prosecution serves political not justice ends

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: The Protest Prosecutions**
- Mass arrests at political protest
- Police overreacted, arrested peaceful protesters
- DA wants to prosecute "to send message"
- You've reviewed evidence: Most arrestees did nothing criminal
- You're assigned to prosecute

**Scenario B: The Selective Prosecution**
- Same conduct occurs regularly, never prosecuted
- This time, defendant is political opponent of DA
- Or defendant is from disfavored group
- Prosecution is selective and discriminatory
- You're ordered to proceed

**Scenario C: The Death Penalty Case**
- You morally oppose death penalty
- Strong case for guilt, but you don't want to seek death
- DA orders you to seek death penalty
- You must choose: Do your "job" or follow conscience

**Your Options:**

**Option 1: Refuse the Assignment**
- Explicitly tell supervisor: "I cannot ethically prosecute this case"
- Request reassignment
- Accept consequences

**Risks:**
- Termination
- Career damage
- Reputation as "difficult"

**Benefits:**
- Conscience intact
- Integrity maintained
- Role model for others

**Option 2: Prosecute, But Sabotage**
- Go through motions but deliberately do poor job
- Tank the case
- Defendant gets acquitted

**Problems:**
- Dishonest
- Violates duties to court, to system
- If discovered, professional discipline
- Not a solution

**Option 3: Prosecute Zealously Despite Beliefs**
- "I'm just doing my job"
- "Following orders"
- Compartmentalize your ethics

**Problems:**
- Nuremberg defense didn't work
- You ARE responsible for your actions
- Damages your soul

**Option 4: Resign**
- "I cannot work in an office that requires this"
- Find different employment
- Maintain integrity

**Benefits:**
- Conscience clear
- Integrity intact
- Freedom from complicity

**Costs:**
- Loss of income
- Career disruption
- Sacrifice

**Option 5: Internal Advocacy + Compliance**
- Argue strenuously against the prosecution
- Document your objections
- If overruled, comply but with internal record
- Work for systemic change

**This is the pragmatic option, but morally complicated.**

**Guiding Questions:**

1. **Is this a matter of judgment** (reasonable people could differ) **or ethics** (objectively wrong)?
   - If judgment: Comply even if you disagree
   - If ethics: Cannot comply

2. **What are you being asked to do?**
   - Present false evidence? → Cannot do
   - Prosecute weak case? → Judgment call
   - Seek unjust sentence? → Ethically problematic

3. **What can you live with?**
   - Years from now, explaining to your children what you did
   - Looking at yourself in mirror
   - Your professional legacy

**The Hard Truth:**
Sometimes integrity requires sacrifice.

If you're not willing to lose your job over principle, you may not have principles—you have preferences.

---

#### Exceptional Situation 4: Discovering Your Office is Systematically Unjust

**The Situation:**
- Over time, you realize your office:
  - Systematically discriminates (racial disparities in charging)
  - Routinely violates defendants' rights
  - Prioritizes convictions over justice
  - Operates corruptly

**This isn't one case—it's the entire system.**

**Examples:**

**Scenario A: Racial Disparities**
- You notice: Black defendants charged more severely than white defendants for same conduct
- Pattern is consistent, undeniable
- When you raise it, you're told "that's just how it is"

**Scenario B: Systemic Brady Violations**
- Discovery practices routinely hide exculpatory evidence
- "Close enough" approach to disclosure requirements
- Culture of concealment

**Scenario C: Corruption**
- Prosecutors have financial

## PART V: LETTERS FROM THE FIELD

### A Letter from a Veteran Prosecutor to a New One

*Dear Young Prosecutor,*

*You're starting your career filled with idealism. You want to seek justice, protect victims, make your community safer. That's beautiful. Hold onto that.*

*But I need to warn you about what's coming.*

*You will face cases where the "right" answer isn't clear. You'll prosecute people you like. You'll decline to prosecute people you despise. You'll lose cases you should have won. You'll win cases that haunt you.*

*You'll be pressured—by victims, by police, by your boss, by the media, by politicians. They'll want you to file charges when you shouldn't. They'll want you to seek sentences that don't fit. They'll want you to win at all costs.*

*Resist.*

*Your job is not to make people happy. Your job is to do justice.*

*Some practical advice from someone who's been there:*

**1. Trust your gut about guilt/innocence.** If something feels wrong about the case, investigate that feeling. Your intuition is telling you something.

**2. Be slow to charge, quick to dismiss.** It's easier to add charges later than to undo the harm of wrongful prosecution.

**3. Disclose more than you think you have to.** Brady violations destroy lives and careers. When in doubt, turn it over.

**4. Don't fall in love with your cases.** The moment you start caring more about winning than about truth, you've lost your way.

**5. Learn to say no.** To your boss, to police, to victims. "No, I won't file that." "No, the evidence doesn't support it." "No, that's not justice."

**6. Document your ethical decisions.** When you decline a case or reduce charges based on principle, write a memo. Protect yourself.

**7. Make friends with defense attorneys.** The good ones will make you a better prosecutor. They'll call you out when you're wrong. Listen to them.

**8. Take care of your mental health.** This job will break you if you let it. Therapy isn't weakness—it's maintenance.

**9. Remember why you took the oath.** On hard days, go back to that moment. Remember what you promised.

**10. Know when to walk away.** If the job is destroying your soul, leave. There are other ways to serve justice.*

*You're going to make mistakes. We all do. What matters is what you do when you discover them.*

*I've convicted an innocent person. I've withheld evidence I should have disclosed. I've overcharged to coerce pleas. I've let pressure influence my decisions.*

*And I've corrected every error I discovered. I've joined exoneration efforts. I've changed my practices. I've become a better prosecutor.*

*Not perfect. Better.*

*That's all you can ask of yourself.*

*Twenty years from now, you'll look back on your career. You'll remember not the cases you won, but the times you showed integrity. The time you dismissed a case everyone wanted you to prosecute because the evidence wasn't there. The time you stood up to your boss. The time you protected someone's rights even though it cost you.*

*Those will be your proudest moments.*

*Good luck. Do justice. And remember: you're not in this alone.*

*Sincerely,*  
*A Prosecutor Who Survived with Integrity (Mostly) Intact*

### A Letter from the Wrongfully Convicted

*Dear Prosecutor,*

*You don't know me. But you convicted me of a crime I didn't commit.*

*I spent 15 years in prison for something I didn't do. Fifteen years of my life. My children grew up without their father. My wife divorced me. My mother died while I was inside.*

*I don't write this to make you feel guilty. I write it so you understand what's at stake when you make your decisions.*

*When you're deciding whether to file charges, I'm the person you should think about. Not the victim (though they matter too). Not your boss. Not your conviction rate.*

*Me. The person whose life you might destroy.*

*I want you to know: I don't entirely blame you. The system failed. The witnesses lied. The police were sloppy. The defense attorney was overworked. The judge made errors. The jury got it wrong.*

*You were one part of a system failure.*

*But you were a part.*

*You presented evidence you should have questioned. You didn't disclose things you should have disclosed. You argued for my guilt with certainty when you should have had doubts.*

*I know you thought you were doing your job. I know you thought I was guilty.*

*But I wasn't.*

*I was finally exonerated. DNA proved it. I'm out now. But I can't get those 15 years back. I can't restore my relationships. I can't undo the trauma.*

*I'm told you joined the motion to vacate my conviction. That you supported my release. That you said you were sorry.*

*Thank you. That meant something.*

*But I need you to do more.*

*I need you to be the prosecutor who never convicts another innocent person. I need you to be the one who questions, who investigates, who discloses, who dismisses when appropriate.*

*I need you to be the prosecutor who, when facing a case like mine, makes different choices.*

*Someone has to be that prosecutor.*

*Please. Let it be you.*

*Because somewhere, right now, there's another innocent person in your jurisdiction. They might end up in your courtroom. Their life is in your hands.*

*What will you do with it?*

*Respectfully,*  
*An Exoneree Who Lost 15 Years*

---

### A Letter from a Victim's Family Member

*Dear Prosecutor,*

*You prosecuted the man who killed my daughter.*

*You won. He's in prison for life. We attended every day of the trial. We gave our victim impact statement at sentencing. Justice was done.*

*But I need to tell you something.*

*During the trial, we wanted blood. We wanted you to throw the book at him. We wanted the death penalty. We wanted him to suffer like we suffered.*

*We pressured you. We called your office daily. We went to the media. We made your life difficult.*

*You explained to us—over and over—that the evidence supported life in prison but not death penalty. You explained the law. You told us you were seeking justice, not vengeance.*

*We were angry at you. We thought you were weak. We wanted a different prosecutor.*

*But now, five years later, I understand.*

*You were right.*

*The man who killed my daughter is in prison forever. That's justice. Killing him wouldn't have brought her back. It wouldn't have healed our pain.*

*You did what we needed, not what we wanted.*

*And I'm writing to thank you for that.*

*I'm also writing to ask you to continue doing that. Because I know there are other families now, in the same place we were, demanding blood. Demanding maximum punishment. Demanding vengeance.*

*They need you to be strong enough to seek justice instead.*

*They need you to explain the law, even when they don't want to hear it.*

*They need you to do what's right, even when they're angry at you for it.*

*They'll thank you later. Just like I'm thanking you now.*

*My daughter's killer is where he belongs. Justice was done. Not because you gave us everything we wanted, but because you did what was right.*

*That's what a prosecutor should do.*

*Please keep doing it.*

*With gratitude,*  
*A Mother Who Lost Her Daughter But Found Justice*

## PART VI: CASE STUDIES IN PROSECUTORIAL ETHICS

### Case Study 1: The Reluctant Witness

**The Facts:**
- Sexual assault case
- Victim gave detailed statement to police immediately after incident
- Victim underwent rape kit examination
- Physical evidence consistent with assault
- Defendant claims consensual encounter
- By time of trial (18 months later), victim has changed her mind about prosecuting
- Victim now says she wants to "move on" and asks you to dismiss
- Victim will be uncooperative witness if you proceed

**The Dilemma:**
Do you:
A) Dismiss per victim's wishes (respecting her autonomy)
B) Proceed anyway (protecting other potential victims)
C) Something else?

**Analysis:**

**Arguments for Dismissal:**
- Victim autonomy: She's an adult; respect her decision
- Uncooperative witness: Case is very difficult to win without her cooperation
- Retraumatization: Forcing her through trial causes additional harm
- Credibility issues: Jury will hear she tried to stop prosecution
- Resources: Better spent on cases where victim wants prosecution

**Arguments for Proceeding:**
- Pattern of behavior: Sex offenders often reoffend
- Victim safety: She may be being threatened/coerced
- Societal interest: Sexual assault is crime against society, not just individual
- Recantation is common: Doesn't mean assault didn't occur
- Other evidence: Physical evidence, initial statement, witnesses

**Additional Considerations:**
- Why did victim change her mind? Interview carefully
- Is there evidence of intimidation or coercion?
- Does defendant have history of similar conduct?
- Are there other witnesses who could testify?
- Can you win without victim's testimony?
- What does victim's advocate recommend?

**Ethical Framework:**

This is not a clear-cut case. Reasonable prosecutors disagree.

**Factors that would lean toward dismissal:**
- Victim is emphatic and consistent in wanting dismissal
- No evidence of coercion
- Defendant has no criminal history
- Limited corroborating evidence
- Victim has received counseling and support in making decision

**Factors that would lean toward proceeding:**
- Evidence of intimidation or coercion of victim
- Defendant has pattern of similar allegations
- Strong physical/testimonial evidence beyond victim
- Victim's initial statement was detailed and credible
- Expert opinion that recantation is trauma response, not truth

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Meet with victim privately and in-depth**
   - Understand her reasons
   - Explore whether she's being threatened
   - Provide resources and support
   - Explain options and consequences

2. **Consult with victim advocate and experts**
   - Get professional assessment
   - Understand trauma dynamics

3. **Evaluate evidence independently**
   - Can you prove case without her testimony?
   - How strong is remaining evidence?

4. **Consider defendant's history**
   - Are there other allegations?
   - Is this pattern behavior?

5. **Make decision transparently**
   - Explain reasoning to victim
   - Document decision thoroughly
   - Accept that reasonable people may disagree

**No perfect answer exists.** Balance victim autonomy, societal interest, likelihood of successful prosecution, and potential for retraumatization.

### Case Study 2: The Favorable DNA

**The Facts:**
- Defendant convicted of rape 12 years ago
- Conviction based on victim identification and circumstantial evidence
- No DNA testing done at trial (pre-DNA era)
- Defendant has maintained innocence, filed multiple unsuccessful appeals
- New defense attorney files motion for DNA testing
- You oppose testing (standard practice)
- Judge orders testing over your objection
- Results come back: DNA from rape kit does NOT match defendant
- DNA matches unknown person
- Defense moves to vacate conviction

**The Dilemma:**
What do you do?

**Option A: Join the Motion to Vacate**
- Acknowledge defendant is likely innocent
- Support immediate release
- Apologize for wrongful conviction
- Help find actual perpetrator

**Option B: Oppose Vacatur and Argue Alternative Theories**
- Argue DNA could be from consensual partner before/after attack
- Argue defendant could have been accomplice (no evidence of this)
- Argue victim ID is still reliable
- Fight to keep conviction

**Option C: Something in Between**
- Don't oppose vacatur but don't affirmatively support it
- Let court decide
- Take neutral position

**Analysis:**

**If You Choose Option B (Fight Exoneration):**

This is tempting because:
- You don't want to admit error
- Case was won fair and square under law at the time
- Maybe there's an innocent explanation
- Your career takes a hit if wrongful conviction acknowledged
- Opens door to civil liability for jurisdiction

But this is **ethically wrong** because:
- DNA evidence is highly probative
- Defendant has sat in prison 12 years for crime he likely didn't commit
- Your duty is to justice, not to protecting convictions
- Fighting obvious innocence destroys your credibility
- It's just cruel

**If You Choose Option C (Neutral):**

This is tempting because:
- Lets you avoid explicit admission of error
- "Let the court decide"
- Maintains some deniability

But this is **ethically weak** because:
- You're abdicating responsibility
- Defendant deserves your active support for justice
- Neutrality when innocence is clear is complicity
- You have more power to effect release than defendant does

**If You Choose Option A (Join Motion):**

This is **ethically correct** because:
- DNA evidence strongly suggests innocence
- Justice requires correcting error
- Defendant has suffered enough
- Your duty is to truth, not to conviction

This is difficult because:
- Admitting error publicly is painful
- Career implications
- May open civil liability
- Victim may feel betrayed

**But it's the right thing to do.**

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediately acknowledge the significance of DNA results**
   - Don't fight the obvious
   - Commission independent review

2. **Meet with defendant and defense attorney**
   - Express that you will support vacatur
   - Explain process and timeline

3. **Meet with victim**
   - This will be traumatic for her
   - Provide support
   - Explain what happened
   - Help her understand this doesn't mean she wasn't assaulted—just that wrong person was convicted

4. **File response joining motion to vacate**
   - Be explicit: Evidence shows defendant is innocent
   - Recommend immediate release
   - Express regret for wrongful conviction

5. **Investigate actual perpetrator**
   - DNA profile now available
   - Run through databases
   - Real rapist is still out there

6. **Systemic review**
   - Were there other similar cases?
   - What reforms are needed?
   - How did this happen?

7. **Public statement**
   - Transparent about error
   - Commit to preventing future wrongful convictions
   - Express regret

**The Bottom Line:**

When DNA clearly excludes the defendant, fighting exoneration is not just ethically wrong—it's monstrous.

Do the right thing. Support release. Help find actual perpetrator.

Your reputation will survive. Your integrity depends on it.

### Case Study 3: The Cop Who Lies

**The Facts:**
- You're prosecuting burglary case
- Police officer testifies at preliminary hearing
- Officer's testimony: Defendant confessed during interrogation
- You've reviewed the video of interrogation
- Defendant didn't confess—he denied involvement throughout
- Officer is lying under oath
- Officer doesn't know you've reviewed video
- This officer has been witness in 50+ of your cases over the years

**The Dilemma:**

**Immediate Question:** What do you do in this case?

**Larger Question:** What do you do about this officer generally?

**Option A: Stay Silent**
- Don't confront officer
- Don't disclose to defense
- Hope it doesn't come up
- Win the case

**This is:**
- **Illegal** (Brady/Giglio violation)
- **Unethical** (knowingly presenting perjury)
- **Career-ending if discovered**
- **Morally inexcusable**

**Option B: Confront Officer Privately**
- Pull officer aside
- Show him the video
- Give him chance to "correct his memory"
- Don't make waves

**This is:**
- **Better than A but still problematic**
- Allows officer to save face
- But doesn't address systemic issue
- Still involves concealment
- What about prior cases?

**Option C: Disclose to Defense and Court**
- Inform defense of perjury
- File motion to dismiss charges
- Report officer to superior
- Testify truthfully if needed

**This is:**
- **Ethically required**
- **Legally required**
- **Career/relationship-damaging**
- **But correct**

**Analysis:**

**What You MUST Do (Legally and Ethically):**

**In This Case:**

1. **Immediately disclose to defense**
   - Provide video of interrogation
   - Explain discrepancy between video and testimony
   - This is exculpatory evidence (Brady/Giglio)

2. **Inform court**
   - File notice that witness testimony was false
   - Request hearing

3. **Move to dismiss**
   - If officer's testimony was essential to probable cause finding
   - Case cannot proceed based on perjured testimony

4. **Do not call officer as witness going forward in this case**

**Regarding Officer Generally:**

5. **Review all pending cases involving this officer**
   - His credibility is now compromised
   - Disclose to all defense attorneys
   - Consider dismissals where his testimony is essential

6. **Review past cases**
   - Were there other lies?
   - Are there wrongful convictions?
   - Convene conviction integrity review

7. **Report to police department**
   - Officer committed perjury
   - Disciplinary action required
   - Potential criminal charges

8. **Create disclosure file ("Giglio list")**
   - Officer's impeachment information must be disclosed in all future cases
   - Effectively ends his usefulness as witness

9. **Report to bar if appropriate**
   - If officer's conduct constitutes obstruction of justice

**The Consequences:**

**For Officer:**
- Disciplinary action, possible termination
- Criminal prosecution for perjury possible
- Civil liability
- Reputation destroyed

**For Your Relationship with Police:**
- You'll be seen as "anti-police"
- Other officers may be less cooperative
- Police union may attack you
- Creates tension

**For Your Cases:**
- Any case relying on this officer may be compromised
- Defendants may seek post-conviction relief
- Your conviction rate takes a hit

**For Your Career:**
- Short-term: difficult
- Long-term: depends on your office's culture

**But:**

**For Justice:**
- You've prevented wrongful convictions
- You've maintained integrity
- You've sent message that perjury is not tolerated
- You've kept your oath

**The Real Question:**

Can you look at yourself in the mirror if you don't report this?

Can you live with the knowledge that this officer may lie in other cases and you said nothing?

Can you face the defendant who's wrongfully convicted because you stayed silent?

**The Answer:**

**You must report it. No matter the cost.**

**Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's career-threatening. Yes, it's uncomfortable.**

**But perjury by police cannot be tolerated. Ever.**

**If you won't stand up to this, you don't deserve to be a prosecutor.**

### Case Study 4: The Prosecutor's Child

**The Facts:**
- Your teenage son is arrested for DUI
- Accident involved (minor property damage, no injuries)
- Blood alcohol 0.12 (over legal limit)
- Your son admits he was drinking and driving
- You're the elected DA
- Arresting officer recognizes your son
- Officer calls you before booking
- Officer says: "How do you want me to handle this?"

**The Dilemma:**

What do you do?

**Option A: "Handle It"**
- Tell officer to let your son go
- No charges filed
- "Boys will be boys"
- Keep it quiet

**This is:**
- **Corruption**
- **Abuse of office**
- **Criminal** (obstruction of justice)
- **Disqualifying** (should result in removal from office)
- **Hypocritical** (you prosecute others for same conduct)

**Option B: Normal Processing But You Supervise**
- Son is arrested and charged
- But you personally supervise prosecution
- Offer diversion program (which you might offer anyone)
- Stay involved to ensure "fairness"

**This is:**
- **Conflict of interest**
- **Appearance of impropriety**
- Even if you're trying to be fair, you can't be objective about your own child

**Option C: Full Recusal**
- Son is arrested and processed normally
- You immediately and publicly recuse entire office
- Request special prosecutor from AG's office
- Your office has no involvement
- Let chips fall where they may

**This is:**
- **Ethically required**
- **Legally required**
- **Painful** (you can't protect your child)
- **Correct**

**Analysis:**

**What You MUST Do:**

1. **Tell officer to process normally**
   - "Arrest him and book him like you would anyone else"
   - No special treatment
   - No favoritism

2. **Immediately and publicly recuse**
   - Announce conflict of interest
   - Request special prosecutor
   - Your entire office recuses

3. **Let special prosecutor handle case**
   - No involvement whatsoever
   - No discussions with special prosecutor
   - No attempt to influence

4. **Be there as a parent, not a prosecutor**
   - Get your son a lawyer (not from your office!)
   - Support him emotionally
   - But let him face consequences

5. **Public statement if necessary**
   - Acknowledge your son was arrested
   - Confirm you've recused
   - Explain process

**Why This Is Hard:**

**Every parental instinct tells you to protect your child.**

You have the power to make this go away. One phone call.

No one would know. Officer is offering. It would be so easy.

Your son made a mistake. He's a good kid. This could ruin his future.

**But:**

**If you use your power to protect your child, you are corrupt.**

**Every defendant you've ever prosecuted deserved the same consideration.**

**Every parent who watched their child go to jail deserved the same opportunity to make it disappear.**

**If you wouldn't make it disappear for them, you can't make it disappear for your child.**

**The Test:**

Imagine the poorest person in your jurisdiction, whose child was arrested for the same offense.

Would you make it disappear for them?

No?

Then you can't do it for your child either.

**The Aftermath:**

Your son will face consequences. Maybe probation, fines, license suspension, community service.

It will be hard on him. It will be hard on you.

**But:**

He'll learn accountability. He'll understand that actions have consequences. He'll see his parent model integrity.

And you'll be able to look at yourself in the mirror.

**If you use your office to protect your child:**

He learns that rules don't apply to powerful people. He learns corruption is acceptable. He learns integrity is optional.

And you become everything you supposedly stand against.

**Which parent do you want to be?**

**Which prosecutor?**

---

## PART VII: THE LONG VIEW

### A. Twenty Years From Now

**Imagine yourself 20 years from now, retired from prosecution.**

**You're at a gathering. Someone asks: "What did you do before you retired?"**

**"I was a prosecutor," you say.**

**"Oh? What was that like?"**

**What will you say?**

**Option A:**
*"It was a great career. I had a 95% conviction rate. Won lots of high-profile cases. Got promoted quickly. Did well for myself."*

**This sounds successful. But it's hollow.**

It doesn't say anything about justice. About integrity. About who you were as a prosecutor.

**Option B:**
*"It was meaningful work. I sought justice for victims and defendants. I made mistakes, but I corrected them. I stood up for what was right, even when it was hard. I'm proud of who I was."*

**This is what matters.**

**Years from now, you won't remember your conviction rate.**

**You'll remember:**
- The time you dismissed a case everyone wanted you to prosecute, because the evidence wasn't there
- The time you supported exoneration of someone you had convicted
- The time you stood up to your boss
- The time you reported police misconduct
- The time you protected someone's rights even though it cost you

**These will be your legacy.**

**Not wins. Integrity.**

---

### B. What Former Prosecutors Wish They'd Known

**From interviews with retired prosecutors:**

**"I wish I'd known..."**

**1. "...that conviction rate doesn't matter in the long run."**
*"I was so focused on my win percentage. I declined cases I should have taken and took cases I should have declined. None of that matters now. What matters is whether I did justice."*

**2. "...that it's okay to lose."**
*"I fought every case like my life depended on it. Sometimes the defense was right. Sometimes I was wrong. I should have conceded more often."*

**3. "...that I should have listened to defense attorneys more."**
*"I treated them as adversaries to be defeated. Many of them were trying to show me things I was missing. I should have listened."*

**4. "...that the prosecutor who dismisses a case can be braver than the one who wins it."**
*"It's easy to prosecute. It's hard to dismiss when everyone wants prosecution. That takes real courage."*

**5. "...that my ego was getting in the way of justice."**
*"I was so worried about being reversed, about being criticized, about looking weak. My ego made me a worse prosecutor."*

**6. "...that I should have reported misconduct sooner."**
*"I knew about cops who lied, prosecutors who hid evidence. I didn't report it because I didn't want to be the snitch. I regret that deeply."*

**7. "...that work-life balance matters."**
*"I sacrificed my family for cases that I barely remember now. I missed my kids growing up. Not worth it."*

**8. "...that prosecuting isn't the only way to seek justice."**
*"I thought if I left prosecution, I'd be abandoning the mission. Now I realize there are many ways to serve justice."*

**9. "...that integrity is more important than advancement."**
*"I compromised my principles to get promoted. Got the promotion. Lost my self-respect. Bad trade."*

**10. "...that I should have trusted my conscience more."**
*"Every time I ignored that voice saying 'this isn't right,' I regretted it. I should have listened."*

---

### C. A Prosecutor's Prayer

*For those moments when you're not sure you can do what's right:*

---

**Grant me the courage**  
to dismiss charges when evidence is lacking,  
even when victims demand prosecution.

**Grant me the wisdom**  
to distinguish between justice and vengeance,  
between punishment and cruelty.

**Grant me the humility**  
to admit when I'm wrong,  
to support exoneration of those I convicted in error.

**Grant me the strength**  
to resist pressure from bosses, police, politicians, media,  
when they demand I compromise justice.

**Grant me the integrity**  
to treat defendants as human beings,  
not as case numbers or conviction statistics.

**Grant me the compassion**  
to remember that every defendant is someone's child,  
every victim deserves my best effort.

**Grant me the honesty**  
to acknowledge my biases and limitations,  
to seek truth even when inconvenient.

**Grant me the backbone**  
to stand alone when necessary,  
to do right even when it costs me.

**Grant me the perspective**  
to remember that my career matters less than someone's freedom,  
my reputation less than justice itself.

**And when I retire,**  
let me look back and say:  
*I kept my oath.*  
*I served justice.*  
*I maintained integrity.*

**That is enough.**

---

## CONCLUSION: YOUR CHOICE

**You stand now at the beginning, middle, or end of your prosecutorial career.**

**You face daily choices about who you will be.**

**Every charging decision, every plea offer, every disclosure, every trial—these are choices about your character.**

**You can be:**
- The prosecutor who seeks conviction at all costs
- The prosecutor who seeks justice even when it's hard
- The prosecutor who becomes corrupted by power
- The prosecutor who exercises power with humility
- The prosecutor who looks away from misconduct
- The prosecutor who confronts it regardless of cost

**Which will you be?**

**The system needs prosecutors who:**
- Have the courage to decline when evidence is insufficient
- Have the integrity to disclose even when it hurts their case
- Have the humility to admit and correct errors
- Have the compassion to see defendants as human beings
- Have the backbone to resist improper pressure
- Have the wisdom to seek justice, not just conviction

**Will you be that prosecutor?**

**The choice is yours.**

**Every single day.**

**In every single case.**

**Your oath was to seek justice.**

**Not to win cases.**  
**Not to please bosses.**  
**Not to advance your career.**  
**Not to satisfy public opinion.**

**Justice.**

**That's all.**

**That's everything.**

**Honor that oath.**

**The defendants in your courtroom, the victims seeking justice, the community you serve, your colleagues watching you, your children learning from you, history judging you—**

**They're all waiting to see which prosecutor you'll be.**

**Be the one justice needs.**

---

*"The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous... While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst."*

— Justice Robert Jackson

**You have that power now.**

**Use it justly.**

**Use it wisely.**

**Use it with the knowledge that every person whose life you touch deserves your best effort at justice.**

**Not your best effort at winning.**

**Your best effort at justice.**

**There's a difference.**

**May you always know it.**

**May you always honor it.**

**May you retire someday knowing:**

**I kept my oath.**

---

## FINAL REFLECTION

If you've read this far, you're the kind of prosecutor who cares about these questions.

That means you're likely already doing the hard work of seeking justice.

**Thank you.**

**The system needs you.**

**Continue.**

**When it's hard, remember why you started.**

**When you're pressured to compromise, remember your oath.**

**When you're tired and cynical, remember that individual lives depend on your integrity.**

**You are not just a cog in a machine.**

**You are a human being with moral agency and immense power.**

**Use both wisely.**

**And know that somewhere, someone you've never met is grateful that you're the prosecutor on their case.**

**Because you're the one who seeks justice.**

**Not just convictions.**

**Justice.**

**Be that prosecutor.**

**Always.**
